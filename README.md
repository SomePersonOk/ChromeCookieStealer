Chrome Cookie Stealer:

Since there is new encryption method that chrome is using now (v20 Cookies) i couldn't find any app to do the job so here it's a simple script it will search for each profile in chrome path and get cookies either be v10, v11, or v20.

if you want to compile yourself make sure all the packages are installed using pip install package, and run the script with admin privilaged CMD.
if you want to use the pre-compiled exe are side panel and there is no need for anything extra.

all the cookies will be decrypted with their profile name and will be saved in the current directory.
