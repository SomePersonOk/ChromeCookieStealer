# Chrome Cookie Decryptor

A Python script that retrieves and decrypts cookies from all Chrome profiles using both old and latest decryption methods. This tool is useful for developers and security researchers who need to analyze cookie data.

## Features

- Decrypts cookies stored in Chrome's SQLite database.
- Supports both v10 and v20 cookie formats.
- Automatically retrieves the necessary encryption keys from Chrome's Local State.
- Outputs decrypted cookies to text files for each profile.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python packages:
  - `pycryptodome`
  - `pypsexec`
  - `pyaes`
  - `pywin32`

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pycryptodome pypsexec pyaes pywin32

Usage
Clone the repository:

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/chrome-cookie-decryptor.git
cd chrome-cookie-decryptor
Run the script:

Make sure you have Chrome closed before running the script to ensure it can access the cookie database.

bash

Verify

Open In Editor
Edit
Copy code
python chrome_cookie_decryptor.py
Output:

The script will generate a text file for each Chrome profile in the current directory, containing the decrypted cookies in a tab-separated format.

How It Works
Profile Path Retrieval: The script retrieves the path to the user's Chrome profiles from the environment variable.

Key Extraction: It loads the Local State JSON file to access the encryption keys used by Chrome.

Cookie Decryption: The script uses the appropriate decryption methods based on the cookie version:

For v10 and v11 cookies, it uses AES GCM mode.
For v20 cookies, it retrieves the decryption key using Windows DPAPI and then decrypts the cookies.
Output Generation: Decrypted cookies are written to text files named after each profile.
